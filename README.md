# Lantranet

## Dev setup

You will need Docker to start.
Simply start the dev environment with:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you need to edit something specifically for your environment, add a `compose.override.yml` file.

## Prod setup

It is made with Github actions automatically when a new release is made in GitHub.
